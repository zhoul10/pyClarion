### Simulation Environment ###

# Let's keep the environment lean. Just a recorder:

class BehaviorRecorder(object):

    def __init__(self):

        self.actions = []

recorder = BehaviorRecorder()

### Agent Setup ###

# In this section, we'll create an agent named 'Alice' with some knowledge 
# about fruits.

# Default node strength

# In general, default strengths are not required. But they are useful.

# Agent assembly

# Agent Architecture

# The initial structure of an agent is specified using construct symbols, which 
# are basic data structures used to identify and reference different components 
# of a pyClarion agent.

# The function make_agent() constructs an agent realizer from a structured 
# collection of construct symbols. This involves initializing an agent realizer 
# object to represent alice and then initializing and placing a set of construct 
# realizer objects within this agent realizer according to the given 
# specifications.

alice = make_agent(
    csym = Agent('Alice'),
    subsystems = {
        Subsystem("NACS"): {
            Chunk("FRUIT"), 
            Chunk("APPLE"), 
            Chunk("JUICE"),
            Feature("color", "#ff0000"), # red
            Feature("color", "#008000"), # green
            Feature("tasty", True),
            Feature("state", "liquid"),
            Feature("sweet", True),
            Flow("Associative Rules", ftype=FlowType.TT),
            Flow("Top Down", ftype=FlowType.TB),
            Flow("Bottom Up", ftype=FlowType.BT),
            Response("Output", itype=ConstructType.Chunk),
            Behavior(
                "Report Associations", 
                response=Response("Output", itype=ConstructType.Chunk)
            )
        }
    },
    buffers = {
        Buffer("Stimulus", outputs=(Subsystem("NACS"),))
    }
)

# The output of make_agent() is not ready to be run since its components' 
# behaviors are not yet defined. Only the general structure of the agent has 
# been defined:
#   - The agent is called 'Alice'
#   - Alice has one subsystem called 'NACS' (Non-action-centered subsystem)
#   - NACS is initialized with some chunks and features representing knowledge 
#     about fruits
#   - NACS has three different activation flows implementing associative, 
#     top-down and bottom-up links
#   - NACS outputs one response which then gets reported (to the simulation 
#     environment)
#   - Alice also has one stimulus buffer which feeds into her NACS 

# Behavioral Specifications

# To specify the behavior of alice, we populate her construct realizers with 
# appropriate components. These components may be swapped or modified during the 
# course of a simulation. A call to alice.ready() will let us know if we have 
# forgotten to define any components.

# Before specifying construct behaviors, let us alias some key construct 
# symbols for ease of reference:

associative_rules = Flow("Associative Rules", ftype=FlowType.TT) 
top_down_links = Flow("Top Down", ftype=FlowType.TB)
bottom_up_links = Flow("Bottom Up", ftype=FlowType.BT)

response = Response("Output", itype=ConstructType.Chunk)
behavior = Behavior("Report Associations", response=response)

nacs = Subsystem("NACS")
stimulus = Buffer("Stimulus", outputs=(Subsystem("NACS"),))

# We begin by setting up the stimulus buffer. ConstantSource simply stores an 
# activation pattern and outputs it every propagation cycle. The stored pattern 
# may be modified over the course of a simulation.

alice[stimulus].source = ConstantSource()

# Next, we define the propagation cycle for alice's NACS. The function 
# nacs_propagation_cycle() will make sure that all necessary propagation steps 
# are executed.

alice[nacs].propagation_rule = nacs_propagation_cycle

# Now we define how activations may flow within alice's NACS.

# Associative rules govern how activations may propagate among chunks in 
# NACS. 

# For this example, the only association that Alice will initially have is one
# taking the concept APPLE to the concept FRUIT. This is implemented as a 
# weighted link between the APPLE and FRUIT chunks. In this particular case, a 
# weight of 1.0 is assigned to the link. 

alice[nacs, associative_rules].junction = SimpleJunction()
alice[nacs, associative_rules].channel = AssociativeRuleCollection(
    assoc={Chunk("FRUIT"): [{Chunk("APPLE"): 1.}]},
    default_strength=default_strength
)

# assoc is a dict whose keys represent conclusion chunks, its 
# values are lists of condition-weight mappings, There is one mapping for each 
# individual rule about a particular conclusion chunk.

# Next, we define interlevel flows. These control how chunks may activate 
# features and features may activate chunks. 

alice[nacs, top_down_links].junction = SimpleJunction()
alice[nacs, top_down_links].channel = TopDownLinks(
    assoc={
        Chunk("APPLE"): {
            "color": (
                1., {Feature("color", "#ff0000"), Feature("color", "#008000")}
            ),
            "tasty": (1., {Feature("tasty", True)})

        }
    },

# features. Linked features are grouped by dimension as inter-level 
# activation propagation applies a dimension-dependent weight to strengths.

alice[nacs, bottom_up_links].junction = SimpleJunction()
alice[nacs, bottom_up_links].channel = BottomUpLinks(
    assoc=alice[nacs, top_down_links].channel.assoc,

# Note that top down and bottom up links in this simulation share the same assoc 
# dict.

# Now we define the behavior of individual nodes (chunks and features). 

for node, realizer in alice[nacs].items_ctype(ConstructType.Node):
    realizer.junction = SimpleNodeJunction(node, default_strength)

# Node junctions determine the final output of a node given recommendations 
# from various afferent flows.

# To determine how responses are selected, we specify a selector for the 
# response construct. 

alice[nacs, response].junction = SimpleJunction()
alice[nacs, response].selector = BoltzmannSelector(temperature=.1)

# The SimpleJunction attached to the response realizer serves to aggregate 
# activations from afferent nodes.

# Effectors link selected chunks to necessary action callbacks. In addition to 
# behavioral responses, action callbacks may implement non-external actions, 
# such as goal-setting, attention allocation, working-memory allocation etc., 
# depending on simulation requirements.

alice[nacs, behavior].effector = MappingEffector(
    chunk2callback={
        Chunk("APPLE"): lambda: recorder.actions.append(Chunk("APPLE")),
        Chunk("JUICE"): lambda: recorder.actions.append(Chunk("JUICE")),

### Simulation Basics ###
#########################

# We are almost ready to start simulating. Let us first give ourselves a tool 
# to summarize the results of an NACS activation cycle.

def summarize_nacs_cycle(nacs, recorder, title, digits=3):

    print(title)

    print(" ", "Strengths:")
    for c, r in nacs.items_ctype(ConstructType.Node):
        strength = round(r.output.view().strengths[c], digits)
        print("   ", c, strength)

    print(" ", "Response:")
    for _, realizer in nacs.items_ctype(ConstructType.Response):
        for c, s in realizer.output.view().strengths.items():
            print("   ", c, round(s, 3))
    # We could just get selected from the response decision packet, but why 
    # not demonstrate that the agent has affected its envirnoment?
    print("   ", "Selected:", recorder.actions.pop())


# Okay. Let's begin simulation.

# To start, the stimulus buffer is set to provide constant activation to the 
# APPLE chunk. This represents presentation of the concept APPLE. Note that 
# there are simplifications. For instance, it is assumed that Alice is made to 
# understand that the cue is APPLE, the fruit, and not e.g., APPLE, the 
# company. 

alice[stimulus].source.update({Chunk("APPLE"): 1.})

# Alice performs one NACS cycle. 

alice.propagate()

# Alice responds.

alice.execute()

# Here is Alice's cognitive state at the end of the trial.

summarize_nacs_cycle(alice[nacs], recorder, 'Initial Trial')

# To finish, we clear Alice's NACS in preparation for the next example.

alice.clear_activations()

### Cue Suppression ###
#######################

# In free association, subjects do not return the cue as their response. This is 
# called cue suppression. But, Alice may return the cue because cue suppression 
# requires input/output filtering (i.e., selective attention), which is a 
# capability not included in the current model. Let's add it. 

# First, we'll define a component capable of carrying out the necessary 
# filtering.

class FilteredSimpleJunction(SimpleJunction):

    def __init__(self, filter_dict = None):

        for node, factor in self.fdict.items():
            if node in d: d[node] *= factor
        return d

# We need to replace the existing junction for nacs appraisals with a new one.
# This is very easy: just assign to buffer.junction!

alice[nacs, response].junction = FilteredSimpleJunction()

# We assume that alice filters out the cue. The decision to do this and its 
# execution are not the responsibility of NACS, so they are not explicitly 
# simulated.

alice[nacs, response].junction.fdict[Chunk("APPLE")] = .0

# Now we run through the trial again.

alice.propagate()
alice.execute()

# Here is Alice's cognitive state at the end of the trial.

### Learning ###

# The code below repeats the same task, but only after Alice suddenly and

# Here is the learning part.
