### Setup ###
#############

### Simulation Environment ###

# Let's keep the environment lean. Just a recorder:

class BehaviorRecorder(object):

    def __init__(self):

        self.actions = []

recorder = BehaviorRecorder()

### Agent Setup ###

# In this section, we'll create an agent named 'Alice' with some knowledge 
# about fruits.

# Constructs

# Construct symbols are used to name, identify, and refer to various Clarion 
# constructs used within a simulation.

# We begin by defining variables for construct symbols that will be used in this 
# simulation.

# Strictly speaking, this step is not mandatory. Construct symbols really behave 
# like symbols, so there is no real need to store them in variables; it may only 
# save us some typing.

fruit_ck = Chunk("FRUIT")
apple_ck = Chunk("APPLE")
juice_ck = Chunk("JUICE")

# Color feature values (below) are hex-codes to emphasize implicitness.
# In practice, it would be better to give constructs easily intelligible names. 

red_mf = Feature(dim="color", val="#ff0000")
green_mf = Feature("color", "#008000")

liquid_mf = Feature("state", "liquid")

# defined

# Behavioral Specifications

# To specify the behavior of alice, we populate her construct realizers with 
# appropriate components. These components may be swapped or modified during the 
# course of a simulation. alice.ready() will let us know if we have forgotten 
# to define any components.

# We begin by setting up the stimulus buffer. ConstantSource simply stores an 
# activation pattern and outputs it every propagation cycle. The stored pattern 
# may be modified over the course of a simulation.

alice[stim_buf].source = ConstantSource()

# Next, we define the propagation cycle for alice's NACS. The function 
# nacs_propagation_cycle() will make sure that all necessary propagation steps 
# are executed.

alice[nacs].propagation_rule = nacs_propagation_cycle

# Now we define how activations may flow within alice's NACS.

# NACS associative rules govern how activations may propagate among chunks in 
# NACS. assoc is a dict whose keys represent conclusion chunks, its 
# values are lists of condition-weight mappings, There is one mapping for each 
# individual rule about a particular conclusion chunk.

alice[nacs, associative_rules_flow].channel = AssociativeRuleCollection(
    assoc={fruit_ck: [{apple_ck: 1.}]},
    default_strength=default_strength
)

# Next, we define interlevel flows. These control how chunks may activate 
# microfeatures and microfeatures may activate chunks. 
# Here, assoc keys are chunks, which are each linked to zero or more 
# microfeatures. Linked microfeatures are grouped by dimension, as inter-level 
# activation propagation applies a dimension-dependent weight to strengths.

# final output of a node given recommendations from various afferent flows.

for node, realizer in alice[nacs].items_ctype(ConstructType.Node):

# response construct. The junction serves to aggregate activations from afferent 
# nodes.

alice[nacs, response].junction = SimpleJunction()
alice[nacs, response].selector = BoltzmannSelector(temperature=.1)

# Effectors link selected chunks to necessary action callbacks. In addition to

# such as goal-setting, attention allocation, working-memory allocation etc., 
# depending on simulation requirements.

### Simulation Basics ###
#########################

# We are almost ready to start simulating. Let us first give ourselves a tool 
# to summarize the results of an NACS activation cycle.

def summarize_nacs_cycle(nacs, recorder, title, digits=3):

    print(title)

    print(" ", "Strengths:")
    for c, r in nacs.items_ctype(ConstructType.Node):
        strength = round(r.output.view().strengths[c], digits)
        print("   ", c, strength)

    print(" ", "Response:")
    for _, realizer in nacs.items_ctype(ConstructType.Response):
        for c, s in realizer.output.view().strengths.items():
            print("   ", c, round(s, 3))
    # We could just get selected from the response decision packet, but why 
    # not demonstrate that the agent has affected its envirnoment?
    print("   ", "Selected:", recorder.actions.pop())


# Okay. Let's begin simulation.

# To start, the stimulus buffer is set to provide constant activation to the 
# APPLE chunk. This represents presentation of the concept APPLE. Note that 
# there are simplifications. For instance, it is assumed that Alice is made to 
# understand that the cue is APPLE, the fruit, and not e.g., APPLE, the 
# company. 
alice[stim_buf].source.update({apple_ck: 1.})

# Alice performs one NACS cycle.

# Alice responds.
alice.execute()

#######################
### Cue Suppression ###
#######################

# A limitation of this model: in free association, subjects do not 
# return the cue as their response. But, Alice does return the cue because cue 
# suppression requires input/output filtering (i.e., selective attention), 
# which is a capability not included in the current model. Let's add it. 

# First, we'll define a component capable of carrying out the necessary 
# filtering.

# We need to replace the existing junction for nacs appraisals with a new one.
# This is very easy: just assign to buffer.junction!
alice[nacs, response].junction = ResponseFilterJunction()

# We assume that alice filters out the cue. The decision to do this and its 
# execution are not the responsibility of NACS, so they are not explicitly 
# simulated.

### Learning ###
################

# Learning is an essential part of Clarion, so a simple example below 
# demonstrates learning in pyClarion. Note that we will again modify Alice on 
# the fly to enable learning.

class HeavyHandedLearningRoutine(object):
    # This routine simply injects some preset knowledge into the NACS.
