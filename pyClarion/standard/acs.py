    Only one condition chunk per rule.

    Generally speaking, activation of action_chunk is equal to some weight 
    multiplied by the activation of the conditon chunk.

    May need to define and enforce a format for representing rules.

    More advanced features:
        - Rule BLAs
        - Subtypes: fixed, irl, rer
            Subtypes may have learning rules and dedicated statistics associated 
            with them; methods for updating knowledge base according to learning 
            rules and stats should be implemented within the class.
